Zavage: The Battle for Olderth

In a time, long, long, long ago, before the hordes and legions of present day, there roamed a score of beasts and men, 
not unlike the ones we find in the Newerth we all know so well. This was a time before there were magics, fire, vines, and surging air.
Bewilderd beasts ensnared in battle, before the humans strong and settled. The lairs and holds were yet unkept, 

It was the time of the old way, the old days.
